// Package pix provides set of drawing functions for simple pixmap based
// displays.
//
// To use this package the display controller must provide only one drawing
// operation wich is drawing a pixmap onto a selected rectangle. This single
// drawing primitive enables to quite efficiently perform common drawing
// operations such as drawing various geometric shapes, images, and text.
